# pyjnius Android-wheel spike — status & handoff

**Purpose of this file:** a self-contained handoff so work can continue in the
WSL-connected Cursor window (a fresh agent or a human). It records what has been
done, how to reproduce it, and the exact next steps. Companion to
`ANDROID_WHEEL_PROPOSAL.md` (the design brief).

---

## TL;DR

The **universal, SDL-agnostic Android wheel works.** pyjnius now builds to
`android_24_arm64_v8a` and `android_24_x86_64` (CPython 3.14) via cibuildwheel,
**with no host app present**, with **no `DT_NEEDED` on any `libSDL`** and **no
undefined SDL symbol** (verified at the ELF level), and the wheels **pip-install**
via cross-download. **Steps 2–8 are done** (incl. real arm64 hardware — Pixel 8a,
Android 16/API 36 — and, as of Step 8, validation inside kivyforge's actual
production Gradle/AGP pipeline, not just the spike's own test harness). The
runtime resolver is
three-tier (SDL3 → SDL2 → `JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs`), and **both** the SDL-independent
path and the SDL-host path are now confirmed on-device:

- **Step 3 (SDL-less):** the cibuildwheel Android testbed on an API-35 x86_64
  emulator ran `autoclass('java.lang.System').getProperty('java.vm.name')` →
  **`Dalvik`**, `JNIEnv` via the tier-3 `dlopen(libnativehelper)` fallback.
- **Step 4 (real SDL2 host):** a **buildozer/p4a Kivy app** (SDL2 bootstrap) built
  against this source and run on an **API-32 x86_64 emulator** resolved the env via
  **tier 2 (`SDL_AndroidGetJNIEnv`)** and round-tripped to `Dalvik` — deterministic
  across relaunches.

**KEY CORRECTION from Step 4:** the original premise that a host-loaded SDL getter
is reachable via `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, …)` is **false on device**. A CPython
extension `dlopen`'d from site-packages does **not** have the host's
`System.loadLibrary`'d SDL in its default lookup scope (empirically NULL on API 32),
so each tier now `dlopen`s the library **by soname** (`libSDL3.so` / `libSDL2.so` /
`libnativehelper.so`) and `dlsym`s the handle — same fix tier 3 already needed.
ELF verification still shows **no** `DT_NEEDED` on any of them (only
`dlopen`/`dlsym@LIBC`). **Step 5** then proved the last criterion — the
Python-implements-Java-interface round-trip (`@java_method` → `invoke0`) — on-device,
with the Java glue delivered **app-side** (bootstrap-template model), not from the wheel.
**Step 6** confirmed the runtime hygiene assumptions: the upstream `ANDROID_ARGUMENT`
thread-detach hook fires, and pyjnius attaches to the host VM without ever calling
`JNI_CreateJavaVM`.

---

## Direction & scope (updated 2026-07-20)

**kivyforge is the only target.** The wheel is no longer chasing portability across
build systems (p4a / ksproject compatibility is explicitly a non-concern — they build
pyjnius from source, not a wheel, and kivyforge aims to displace p4a). Concretely:

- **Ship a plain, Java-free Python wheel** — patched pyjnius source (SDL link removed,
  `get_libraries()` → `['log']`, runtime SDL-getter JNIEnv resolver) → cibuildwheel →
  `arm64-v8a` (and `x86_64` for the emulator). No Java payload, no `.java/` machinery.
- **JNIEnv acquisition stays the validated SDL-getter resolver** (Step 4). The wheel's
  `.so` finds the SDL-provided VM itself via `dlopen(libSDL*.so)` + `dlsym`, so it needs
  **nothing from the bootstrap for the env**. (Note: "JNI_OnLoad inside the wheel" is
  *not* used and is not possible — ART never calls `JNI_OnLoad` for a `.so` imported by
  CPython via `dlopen`.)
- **The Java glue moves to kivyforge's bootstrap templates.** `NativeInvocationHandler.java`
  is generated/delivered like `MainActivity.java` / `PythonActivity.java` and compiled +
  dex'd by the app's own Gradle. This **supersedes** the earlier `.java/` dot-directory
  decision and makes the p4a-consumption work (and its draft issue) obsolete.
- **Upstream PR to `kivy/pyjnius`: deferred** — revisit after the glue round-trip is proven.

Superseded below (kept only for history, marked as such): the `.java/` Java-glue
decision, the consumer-compatibility matrix, and the draft p4a issue appendix.

## Environment (WSL2)

- Host: **WSL2, Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, x86_64**
- Python **3.14.4**, pip **25.1.1**, uv **0.11.28**
- Java **17** (`/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64`)
- Android SDK at **`~/android-sdk`** (`sdkmanager 20.0`); cibuildwheel auto-installed
  **NDK 27.3.13750724**
- **cibuildwheel 4.1.0** (installed as a `uv` tool → `~/.local/bin/cibuildwheel`)
- `/dev/kvm` present, but the user is **not yet in the `kvm` group** (needed for the
  emulator; requires a one-time privileged step — see Next steps)

**Environment file:** `~/.pyjnius-spike-env.sh` sets `ANDROID_HOME`,
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, `JAVA_HOME`, and `PATH`. Source it before any build:

```bash
source ~/.pyjnius-spike-env.sh
```

**Repo:** this working copy is `~/pyjnius-spike`, a local `git clone` of
`/mnt/c/Users/ellio/PycharmProjects/pyjnius`. `origin` therefore points at the
Windows path — repoint it at the GitHub fork before any upstream PR.

- Build outputs: `~/wheelhouse/`

## The two source changes (Android-only; no desktop impact)

### 1. `jnius_config/env.py` — drop the hard SDL link

`AndroidJavaLocation.get_libraries()` now returns `['log']` instead of
`['SDL2', 'log']`. A `DT_NEEDED` on a specific `libSDL*.so` would lock the wheel
to one SDL/Kivy generation and fail to `dlopen` against the other. (`jnius/env.py`
is just a shim that re-exports `jnius_config.env`.)

### 2. `jnius/jnius_jvm_android.pxi` — resolve the JNIEnv at runtime (three-tier)

Replaced the direct `extern SDL_AndroidGetJNIEnv()` call with a runtime
`dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, ...)` resolver that tries, in order:

1. `SDL_GetAndroidJNIEnv` (SDL3)
2. `SDL_AndroidGetJNIEnv` (SDL2)
3. `JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs` + `AttachCurrentThread` (SDL-independent) — **Step 2**

The SDL getters return a `JNIEnv*` directly. The `JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs` fallback
(`_jnienv_from_created_vm()`) `dlsym`s the symbol, retrieves the process' existing
JavaVM, and `AttachCurrentThread`s to get the `JNIEnv`. If all three fail it
raises a clear `RuntimeError` naming the host contract.

> **API-level scope of the three tiers (settled).** Tiers 1–2 (SDL) are the
> primary path and work on **all** supported API levels (≥ 24): a Kivy/SDL host
> `System.loadLibrary`s SDL, SDL's own `JNI_OnLoad` captures the JavaVM, and SDL
> re-exposes it via the getter we `dlsym`. Tier 3 (`JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs`) is
> **best-effort, effectively API 31+**: that symbol only became a public
> `libnativehelper` export in Android 12 / API 31 (`introduced=S`,
> [android/ndk#1969](https://github.com/android/ndk/issues/1969)); on API 24–30
> it's outside the app linker namespace and the `dlsym` typically returns `NULL`,
> so a non-SDL host there falls through to the `RuntimeError`. This is fine —
> `minSdk` stays 24 because the SDL path covers those levels for the real target.
>
> **`JNI_OnLoad` is *not* an alternative here.** It's the officially-blessed,
> all-API way to receive the JavaVM, but Android only calls it for libs loaded
> via `System.loadLibrary` (ART does `dlopen` + `dlsym("JNI_OnLoad")`). This `.so`
> is a CPython extension loaded by a plain `dlopen()` on `import`, so ART never
> calls a `JNI_OnLoad` defined in it — it would be dead code. The all-API
> SDL-independent option, if ever needed, is an explicit host-provided setter
> (a §5 runtime-contract API), not autodetection.

Removing every direct symbol reference is **required**, not just preferred: the
NDK link uses `-Wl,--no-undefined`, so any leftover undefined symbol (SDL *or*
JNI) would fail the link. The ELF check below confirms none survive.

> These edits are committed and pushed on branch
> **`spike/android-universal-wheel`** (tracks `origin`). Remotes: `origin` →
> `github.com/ElliotGarbus/pyjnius` (the fork), `upstream` → `github.com/kivy/pyjnius`,
> `local` → the Windows clone `/mnt/c/Users/ellio/PycharmProjects/pyjnius`.

## Reproduce the build

```bash
source ~/.pyjnius-spike-env.sh
cd ~/pyjnius-spike

# The Android branch of jnius.pyx needs config.pxi + a pre-generated jnius.c
# (Cython is a build-only tool; consumers of the wheel do not need it).
echo "DEF JNIUS_PLATFORM = 'android'" > jnius/config.pxi
uvx --from "Cython~=3.1.2" cython -3 jnius/jnius.pyx -o jnius/jnius.c

# API level, ABIs, and build frontend are now pinned in
# pyproject.toml [tool.cibuildwheel.android] — no manual exports needed.
# --only computes the platform, so no CIBW_PLATFORM either.
cibuildwheel --only cp314-android_x86_64    --output-dir ~/wheelhouse
cibuildwheel --only cp314-android_arm64_v8a --output-dir ~/wheelhouse
```

### ELF verification (proves the universal design)

```bash
READELF=~/android-sdk/ndk/27.3.13750724/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/llvm-readelf
# unzip a wheel, then:
$READELF -d        jnius/jnius*.so | grep NEEDED       # -> libm liblog libpython3.14 libdl libc  (NO libSDL)
$READELF --dyn-syms jnius/jnius*.so | grep -i sdl      # -> (none)
$READELF --dyn-syms jnius/jnius*.so | grep -iE "JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs|AttachCurrentThread"  # -> (none: dlsym'd / vtable, not linked)
$READELF --dyn-syms jnius/jnius*.so | grep -i dlsym    # -> dlsym@LIBC (the runtime resolver)
```

### pip cross-install check

```bash
python3 -m pip install --only-binary=:all: --platform android_24_arm64_v8a \
    --python-version 3.14 --target /tmp/x --no-deps \
    ~/wheelhouse/pyjnius-1.7.0-cp314-cp314-android_24_arm64_v8a.whl
```

---

## Acceptance criteria status (see proposal §8)

- [x] Builds `android_24_arm64_v8a` **and** `android_24_x86_64`, no host app present
- [x] `pip install` cross-download installs cleanly
- [x] Imports/runs on an emulator/device — **both paths confirmed.**
      (a) SDL-less: cibuildwheel testbed, API-35 x86_64 emulator, env via tier-3
      `dlopen(libnativehelper)` + `JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs` → `Dalvik`.
      (b) Real SDL2 host: buildozer/p4a Kivy app (SDL2 bootstrap) on an API-32
      x86_64 emulator, env via **tier 2 `SDL_AndroidGetJNIEnv`** → `Dalvik`,
      deterministic across relaunches.
      (c) **Real arm64 hardware (Step 7):** Pixel 8a, arm64-v8a, Android 16/API 36,
      env via **tier 2 `SDL_AndroidGetJNIEnv`**, all markers green, ELF clean.
      **SDL3** host not yet exercised (Kivy is SDL2; would need an SDL3 host build).
- [x] Python-implements-Java-interface round-trip — **PROVEN on-device (Step 5)** with
      the glue delivered **app-side** (`android.add_src`, bootstrap-template model), NOT
      from the wheel. On an API-32 SDL2 emulator a Python `Comparator` was driven by
      `java.util.Collections.sort` (`compare` called 3×, String args in, `int` return used
      to sort → `['apple','banana','cherry']`) and a Python `Runnable` was called back via
      `java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run()` — both through
      `NativeInvocationHandler.invoke0`. See "Step 5" below.
- [x] Reproducible from pinned inputs (locked into `pyproject.toml`
      `[tool.cibuildwheel.android]`; NDK pinned via the cibuildwheel version).
      Caveat: toolchain inputs are pinned, but wheels are not yet *bit-for-bit*
      identical (would additionally need `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` etc.)

## Reproducibility pins

Locked in `pyproject.toml` `[tool.cibuildwheel.android]` except where noted.
cibuildwheel has **no NDK-version key**: the NDK is a function of the cibuildwheel
version, so pinning cibuildwheel pins the NDK.

| Input | Value | Where pinned |
|---|---|---|
| NDK | 27.3.13750724 | implied by cibuildwheel 4.1.0 (documented in `pyproject.toml` comment) |
| ANDROID_API_LEVEL | 24 | `[tool.cibuildwheel.android].environment` |
| ABIs | arm64_v8a (ship), x86_64 (test) | `[tool.cibuildwheel.android].archs` |
| build frontend | `build` (Android forbids `pip`) | `[tool.cibuildwheel.android].build-frontend` |
| cibuildwheel | 4.1.0 | operational (uv tool); pin in CI when set up |
| Cython | ~=3.1.2 (3.1.8 used) | `[build-system].requires` |
| CPython target | 3.14 (cp314); add 3.15 pre-release via `--enable cpython-prerelease` | build invocation (`--only`) |

> Verified: building with **no** `ANDROID_API_LEVEL`/`CIBW_PLATFORM` exports still
> produces `android_24_*` — the config alone drives it.

---

## Next steps (agreed plan: option 2 then 3)

### Step 2 — SDL-independent `JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs` fallback — DONE ✅

Implemented in `jnius_jvm_android.pxi` as `_jnienv_from_created_vm()` /
`_resolve_get_created_javavms()`: if neither SDL getter resolves, obtain the
process' JavaVM via `JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs` and `AttachCurrentThread` to get the
`JNIEnv`. See Step 3 for the empirical correction to *how* the symbol is resolved
(`dlopen` by soname, not `RTLD_DEFAULT`). Confirmed not linked (ELF check).

### Step 3 — on-device smoke test — DONE ✅

Ran via cibuildwheel's Android testbed on a `--managed maxVersion` (API-35)
x86_64 emulator (KVM available). Result:

```
ANDROID_SMOKE_OK vm.name=Dalvik vendor=The Android Project java.version=0
✓ cp314-android_x86_64 finished
```

`autoclass('java.lang.System')` resolved and `getProperty('java.vm.name')`
returned `Dalvik` — a real ART round-trip, with the `JNIEnv` from the tier-3
fallback (the testbed has no SDL). (`java.version` is `0` on Android; that's
normal — `java.vm.*` carries the real info.) Test config lives in
`pyproject.toml` `[tool.cibuildwheel.android].test-command`.

> **KEY EMPIRICAL FINDING (changed the implementation).** The first run *failed*:
> `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs")` returned NULL **even on API 35**.
> "Public export at API 31+" means you may *link* `-lnativehelper`, not that the
> symbol is reachable via `RTLD_DEFAULT` — `libnativehelper.so` isn't in the
> extension's default lookup scope. Fix: **`dlopen("libnativehelper.so")` by
> soname** (permitted for apps on API 31+) then `dlsym` the handle. `dlopen` is
> runtime-only, so ELF re-verification shows **no new `DT_NEEDED`** (still no
> libSDL/libnativehelper/libart; only `dlopen`/`dlsym@LIBC`). After this change the
> testbed passes.

### Step 4 — real SDL2 host on device — DONE ✅

cibuildwheel's testbed has **no SDL loaded**, so Step 3 only exercised tier 3, not
the SDL getters. Step 4 closes that gap with a real SDL2 host: a minimal
**buildozer/p4a Kivy app** (`~/sdl-host-test/`, SDL2 bootstrap) built against *this*
source (via `P4A_pyjnius_DIR` + a local recipe that drops p4a's link-time getter
patches and keeps `use_cython.patch`) and run on an **API-32 x86_64 emulator**
(`pyjnius_x86_64` AVD). A one-line `__android_log_print` in the resolver reports the
winning tier to logcat:

```
I pyjnius : JNIEnv source: tier 2 SDL2 (SDL_AndroidGetJNIEnv)
I python  : SDL_HOST_SMOKE_OK vm.name=Dalvik vendor=The Android Project java.version=0
```

Deterministic across relaunches. ELF re-check of the p4a-built `jnius.so`: `NEEDED`
= only `libpython3.14.so`, `liblog.so`, `libdl.so`, `libc.so` — **no libSDL/
libnativehelper/libart**, no directly-linked SDL/`JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs` symbol,
`dlopen`/`dlsym@LIBC` present.

> **KEY CORRECTION (changed the SDL path too).** The first Step-4 run resolved via
> **tier 3**, not the SDL getter, even though libSDL2 was loaded — i.e.
> `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "SDL_AndroidGetJNIEnv")` returned NULL. This falsifies the
> spike's original premise (a host-loaded SDL symbol is reachable via
> `RTLD_DEFAULT`). Same root cause as tier 3: an extension `dlopen`'d from
> site-packages does not have the host's `System.loadLibrary`'d SDL in its default
> lookup scope. Fix: `_resolve_sdl_getter()` now tries `RTLD_DEFAULT` first, then
> **`dlopen`s the SDL soname** (`libSDL3.so`/`libSDL2.so`) and `dlsym`s the handle
> — still runtime-only, no `DT_NEEDED`. After this change tier 2 fires. On API
> 24–30 (no tier 3) this SDL path is what carries the wheel; the dlopen-by-soname
> approach works on those levels because libSDL* is an app lib in the app linker
> namespace.

Not yet exercised at this point: an **SDL3** host (Kivy is SDL2) and **arm64** on real
hardware. (arm64-on-hardware was subsequently done — see Step 7.)

### Step 5 — glue round-trip via app-side (bootstrap-template) delivery — DONE ✅

Proves the *Python-implements-a-Java-interface* path with the new direction's delivery
model: the wheel ships **no** Java, and `org.jnius.NativeInvocationHandler` is delivered
**app-side** exactly as kivyforge will ship it as a bootstrap template.

Harness changes (`~/sdl-host-test/`):

- **Wheel/recipe made Java-free.** The stock p4a `PyjniusRecipe.postbuild_arch` copies
  `jnius/src/org` into the dex (`ctx.javaclass_dir`). The local `PyjniusSpikeRecipe` now
  overrides `postbuild_arch` to **skip** that copy (calls the grandparent
  `PyProjectRecipe.postbuild_arch`), so the recipe contributes no Java.
- **Glue delivered app-side.** `NativeInvocationHandler.java` lives at
  `sdl-host-test/javaglue/org/jnius/` and is added via `android.add_src = ./javaglue`
  → a Gradle `srcDir` (verified: `java {srcDir '.../javaglue'}`; the dist's
  `src/main/java/.../org/jnius/` copy is gone). So the class in the dex comes **only**
  from the app-side file.
- **Round-trip exercised** (`app/main.py`): a Python `java.util.Comparator` driven by
  `Collections.sort`, and a Python `java.lang.Runnable` driven by
  `java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run()`.

Logcat on the API-32 SDL2 emulator:

```
I pyjnius : JNIEnv source: tier 2 SDL2 (SDL_AndroidGetJNIEnv)
I python  : SDL_HOST_SMOKE_OK vm.name=Dalvik ...
I python  : PROXY_COMPARATOR_OK calls=3 ordered=['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
I python  : PROXY_RUNNABLE_OK
I python  : PROXY_ROUNDTRIP_OK
```

`compare` was invoked 3× with String args and its `int` return drove the sort → the
full args-in/value-out callback goes through `invoke0`. No `ClassNotFoundException`
(glue resolved), no CheckJNI abort, process stayed alive.

> **Harness gotcha (not a wheel bug):** the first attempt used `Thread(runnable).run()`
> and hit a **CheckJNI abort** — pyjnius resolved the single-proxy-arg constructor to
> `Thread(String)` and passed the proxy as a String. Switched to the unambiguous
> `FutureTask(Runnable, V)` 2-arg ctor. This is a pyjnius overload-resolution sharp edge
> to note for kivyforge docs, unrelated to the wheel/glue.

### Step 6 — thread-detach hook + no-VM-creation — DONE ✅

Same harness, two extra runtime checks (`app/main.py`):

- **Thread-detach hook fires.** The upstream `ANDROID_ARGUMENT`-gated wrapper in
  `jnius/__init__.py` wraps `threading.Thread.run` to call `jnius.detach()` in a
  `finally`. Spawned a Python `threading.Thread` that does a JNI call
  (`System.getProperty`), then joined it; a temporary wrapper around `jnius.detach`
  observed the call. Logcat: `THREAD_DETACH_OK calls=1 threads=['detach-probe']`.
  Confirms JNI thread hygiene works for free with kivyforge's bootstrap (which sets
  `ANDROID_ARGUMENT`); nothing to build.
- **Attaches to host VM, never creates one.** `jnius_config.vm_running` is set `True`
  only by the desktop/dlopen `JNI_CreateJavaVM` paths; on Android it stays `False`.
  Logcat: `VM_ATTACH_OK vm_running=False options=[] (attached to host VM, no
  JNI_CreateJavaVM)`. Confirms `jnius_config` is runtime-inert on Android.

### Step 7 — real arm64 hardware (Pixel 8a, Android 16 / API 36) — DONE ✅

The shipping ABI, on a physical device (not the emulator). Rebuilt the same harness for
`android.archs = arm64-v8a` (full from-scratch arch bootstrap of python3/SDL2/kivy/our
pyjnius) and ran it on a **Pixel 8a, arm64-v8a, Android 16 (API 36)**, attached to WSL2
over USB via `usbipd-win` (`usbipd bind`/`attach --wsl`; install needed
`adb install --no-streaming` because streaming installs stall over the usbip transport).

All checks green — same markers as the emulator, one level newer OS:

```
I pyjnius : JNIEnv source: tier 2 SDL2 (SDL_AndroidGetJNIEnv)
I python  : SDL_HOST_SMOKE_OK vm.name=Dalvik ...
I python  : PROXY_COMPARATOR_OK calls=3 ordered=['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
I python  : PROXY_RUNNABLE_OK
I python  : THREAD_DETACH_OK calls=1 threads=['detach-probe']
I python  : VM_ATTACH_OK vm_running=False options=[]
I python  : ALL_CHECKS_OK
```

ELF re-check of the **arm64** `jnius.so` (NDK r27d, Android 24, stripped): `NEEDED` =
only `libpython3.14.so`, `liblog.so`, `libdl.so`, `libc.so` — no libSDL/libnativehelper/
libart, no SDL/`JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs`/`JNI_CreateJavaVM` symbol refs, `dlopen`/
`dlsym@LIBC` present. Identical clean profile to the x86_64 build.

> **16 KB page alignment (Android 15+/16) — a toolchain concern, not a source one.**
> On the Pixel 8a (Android 16) the app showed a compatibility warning about 16 KB
> alignment. Investigated: every `.so` in the **p4a test harness** (libpython3.14,

### Later

- **Java-glue delivery — DECIDED (direction change): plain Java-free wheel; the glue
  (`NativeInvocationHandler.java`) lives in kivyforge's bootstrap templates.** See
  "Java-glue delivery" below. (Supersedes the earlier `.java/` dot-directory decision.)
- ~~Lock the pins into a `[tool.cibuildwheel]` config in `pyproject.toml`.~~ DONE ✅
- Prove the glue round-trip (`PythonJavaClass`/`@java_method`) with the glue delivered
  as a bootstrap file — see "What we still need to prove".
- Upstream PR to `kivy/pyjnius` (SDL-link removal + runtime resolver): **deferred** —
  decide after the glue round-trip is proven.

## Java-glue delivery — decision & consumer compatibility

### What the glue is

A single ~40-line class, `org.jnius.NativeInvocationHandler` (in
`jnius/src/org/jnius/`), with a `native invoke0(...)` method bound at runtime via
`RegisterNatives`. It is **only** needed for the *Python-implements-a-Java-interface*
feature (`PythonJavaClass`/`@java_method`), used in `create_proxy_instance`
(`jnius_proxy.pxi`) via `autoclass('org.jnius.NativeInvocationHandler')`. Plain
`autoclass` + method calls need no glue (Step 3 passed with none present). The hard
requirement is runtime: the class must be **compiled + dex'd into the APK** and
findable by the classloader pyjnius uses — a `.whl` carries no `.dex`, so the
source (or a compiled form) must reach the app's dex step. It cannot be eliminated:
a `java.lang.reflect.Proxy` handler can't be built from pure Python.

### Decision (updated 2026-07-20): plain Java-free wheel + glue in the kivyforge bootstrap

**Direction change.** Earlier this spike chose option B — ship the glue as source in a
`.java/` dot-directory for a generic downstream extractor (`pyjnius-builder`/`ksproject`).
That is now **dropped**. kivyforge is the only target, so:

- **The wheel ships no Java at all** — just the patched pyjnius Python + `.so` (SDL link
  removed, `get_libraries()` → `['log']`, runtime SDL-getter resolver validated in Step 4).
- **`NativeInvocationHandler.java` becomes a kivyforge bootstrap template**, generated/
  delivered like `MainActivity.java` / `PythonActivity.java`, so the app's own Gradle/AGP
  compiles + dex'es it into the APK.

Why the change:

- **Wrong tool for the problem.** The `.java/` convention is general machinery for
  arbitrary, unpredictable third-party Java. pyjnius needs one small, fixed ~40-line file.
- **Unproven at scale.** No real package — pyjnius included — actually uses
  `pyjnius-builder`/`ksp-builder` today; it targets a hypothetical future plugin ecosystem.
- **The wheel is self-sufficient for the env.** The `.so` resolves the JNIEnv itself via
  the SDL getter (Step 4), so it needs nothing from the bootstrap for the env — the *only*
  thing the bootstrap must supply is the Java glue. Putting it in the templates keeps that
  in one place kivyforge already owns.
- **Not contradicted by desktop precedent.** Desktop pyjnius bundles a *compiled* `.class`
  inside its own namespace, self-consumed by its self-created JVM — a different mechanism,
  not prior art for cross-build-system source injection.

**Matched-pair coupling (must document — nothing enforces it).** The wheel's `invoke0`
native-method contract and the bootstrap's `NativeInvocationHandler.java` are a matched
pair that must move together. With `.java/` gone, no packaging step catches drift.
Mitigations: pyjnius already resolves `autoclass('org.jnius.NativeInvocationHandler')` at
proxy-creation, so a mismatch surfaces as a clear `ClassNotFound`/`NoSuchMethod` at first
use (not silent corruption); add a version comment in **both** the wheel build script and
the bootstrap template, and consider a runtime version-constant check.

### Runtime notes (audited from the real wheel; no code changes needed)

- **Thread-detach hook is already upstream.** `jnius/__init__.py` (unmodified, every
  release; lines 75–89 here) installs an `ANDROID_ARGUMENT`-gated `threading.Thread.run`
  wrapper that calls `jnius.detach()` on thread exit — correct JNI hygiene. kivyforge's
  bootstrap already sets `ANDROID_ARGUMENT`, so this works for free. **Do not
  reimplement**; just confirm it fires during smoke-testing.
- **`env` / `jnius_config` are runtime-inert on Android — but `env` is build-time
  load-bearing.** `setup.py` imports `jnius_config/env.py` for `get_libraries()` → `['log']`
  (the SDL-link removal). At *runtime*, `jnius/__init__.py` imports `get_java_setup` but
  only uses it on `win32`; `jnius_config.py` (classpath/JVM options) is moot because the
  wheel never calls `JNI_CreateJavaVM` — it attaches to the bootstrap's existing VM.
  Document as runtime-inert; no code change.

### Superseded — `.java/` decision & p4a consumption (history)

The prior direction shipped the glue as source in a `.java/` dot-directory so any generic
consumer (`ksproject` as-is, kivyforge/p4a with an extractor) could route it into the dex
step, and included a draft p4a issue asking the maintainer to teach the prebuilt-wheel
installer to extract `.java/`. **All of that is obsolete** under the kivyforge-only,
Java-free-wheel direction. See git history (pre-2026-07-20) for the full matrix and the
draft issue if p4a interop is ever revisited.

## What we still need to prove (updated direction)

Ordered by importance. The env-resolution work (Steps 2–4) is done; the open items are
now mostly about the glue path and the new delivery model.

1. ~~**Glue round-trip, glue delivered as a bootstrap file (PRIMARY, never yet proven).**~~
   **DONE ✅ (Step 5).** Built an app where `NativeInvocationHandler.java` is delivered as
   an app-side Java source (`android.add_src`, simulating the bootstrap template), *not*
   from the wheel or p4a's recipe (the recipe's `postbuild_arch` glue copy was overridden
   off), and confirmed `PythonJavaClass`/`@java_method` proxies fire `invoke0` on-device
   (Comparator + Runnable). See "Step 5".
2. ~~**Thread-detach hook fires.**~~ **DONE ✅ (Step 6).** Confirmed the
   `ANDROID_ARGUMENT`-gated `threading.Thread.run` wrapper calls `jnius.detach()` on
   worker-thread exit (`THREAD_DETACH_OK calls=1`).
3. ~~**`jnius_config`/`env` inert at runtime.**~~ **DONE ✅ (Step 6).** No
   `JNI_CreateJavaVM` path taken — `jnius_config.vm_running` stayed `False`
   (`VM_ATTACH_OK`); attaches to the bootstrap VM only.
4. **Coverage gaps carried over from Step 4:** ~~**arm64 on real hardware**~~ **DONE ✅
   (Step 7** — Pixel 8a, arm64-v8a, Android 16/API 36, all markers green, ELF clean).
   **Only remaining: an SDL3 host** (Kivy is SDL2, so tier 1 `SDL_GetAndroidJNIEnv` is
   still unexercised on device — though its code path is identical to the validated tier 2).

## Open risks to settle empirically

- ~~Is `JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs` reliably `dlsym`-able and does it reach ART across
  API levels?~~ **SETTLED EMPIRICALLY (Step 3).** It's a public `libnativehelper`
  export only on **API 31+** (`introduced=S`, [android/ndk#1969](https://github.com/android/ndk/issues/1969)),
  and `RTLD_DEFAULT` does **not** reach it even at API 35 — must `dlopen`
  `libnativehelper.so` by soname. With that, ART round-trip confirmed on an API-35
  emulator. Best-effort tier 3 (API 31+); SDL path (tiers 1–2) carries API 24–30.
  A 24–30 non-SDL check would just confirm the documented fall-through to RuntimeError.
- ~~Does `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, ...)` find a host-loaded SDL getter on bionic at the
  target API levels?~~ **SETTLED EMPIRICALLY (Step 4): NO.** On a real p4a SDL2
  host (API 32) `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "SDL_AndroidGetJNIEnv")` returned NULL despite
  libSDL2 being loaded — an extension `dlopen`'d from site-packages doesn't see the
  host's `System.loadLibrary`'d SDL in its default scope. Fix applied: `dlopen` the
  SDL soname (`libSDL3.so`/`libSDL2.so`) and `dlsym` the handle (like tier 3). With
  that, tier 2 resolves and round-trips to `Dalvik`. Still open: **SDL3** host and
  **arm64 on real hardware** (only SDL2 + x86_64 emulator exercised so far).

## Productionization & consumption (2026-07-21)

Phase 1 of the delivery plan is done and committed (`1b45cf1`): the spike source
is now PR-quality and both wheels rebuild clean.

- **Code productionized.** Stripped the `__android_log_print` tier instrumentation
  from `jnius_jvm_android.pxi`; made the Android wheel **truly Java-free** in
  `setup.py` (skips `javac`/`is_jdk` and prunes `src/org/jnius/*` from
  `package_data` when `PLATFORM == 'android'`); pinned
  `LDFLAGS = -Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384` in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Rebuilt + verified** (`~/wheelhouse`, cp314): arm64_v8a + x86_64 are Java-free
  (only the `.so`), no libSDL `DT_NEEDED`, `0x4000` (16 KB) LOAD alignment,
  `dlopen`/`dlsym`-only. x86_64 on-device testbed: `ANDROID_SMOKE_OK vm.name=Dalvik`.
- **No desktop regression** (verified): desktop `build_ext` + `import jnius` +
  `autoclass` + a `Comparator` proxy round-trip all pass on Java 17. All `setup.py`
  changes are no-ops on the desktop path.
- **PR scaffolding added** (for the eventual upstream PR): `.github/workflows/
  android-wheels.yml` (cibuildwheel build+test matrix + release-triggered PyPI
  trusted-publishing) and `docs/source/android-wheel.rst` (runtime + Java-glue
  contract, build steps, 16 KB note).

**Build gotchas (baked into the CI workflow and the doc):**

- **Pre-generate `jnius.c`.** On Android `setup.py` compiles a pre-generated
  `jnius.c` (Cython is build-only); it's gitignored, so CI/local must run
  `printf "DEF JNIUS_PLATFORM = 'android'\n" > jnius/config.pxi && cython -3
  jnius/jnius.pyx -o jnius/jnius.c` first.
- **Build from a clean tree.** `python -m build --no-isolation` reuses
  `build/lib.android-*`; a stale dir from an earlier build **re-injects the Java
  payload** and silently breaks the Java-free guarantee. `rm -rf build` first. A
  fresh CI checkout is inherently clean.
- **Local-only: keep temp off the tmpfs.** In this WSL sandbox `/tmp` is a ~4 GB
  tmpfs and `GRADLE_USER_HOME` is pinned there; the x86_64 emulator testbed
  exhausts it. Set `TMPDIR` and `GRADLE_USER_HOME` to the big ext4 disk. Hosted CI
  runners are unaffected.

**kivyforge consumption (interim, before the wheel is on PyPI):**

1. `pip install` the local `pyjnius-1.7.0-cp314-cp314-android_24_arm64_v8a.whl`
   (from `~/wheelhouse` / a local index) into the app's site-packages.
2. kivyforge's bootstrap emits `org/jnius/NativeInvocationHandler.java` as a
   generated template (like `MainActivity.java`) and dexes it into the APK — the
   wheel ships none. Proven app-side in Step 5 (`sdl-host-test/javaglue/`).
3. Keep the wheel's `invoke0` contract and the template a **matched pair**
   (see the coupling warning above); a mismatch is a `ClassNotFound`/`NoSuchMethod`
   at first proxy creation.
4. Ensure the bootstrap libs are 16 KB-aligned and the APK is 16 KB zip-aligned
   (a kivyforge toolchain task — the wheel already satisfies its half).

---

## Step 8 — validated inside kivyforge's real production pipeline — DONE ✅ (2026-07-28)

Everything above (Steps 2–7) exercised the wheel through the spike's own
buildozer/p4a test harness, not through kivyforge itself. This step closes that
gap: the actual `pyjnius` wheel built here was consumed by **kivyforge's own
Gradle/AGP bootstrap** (not p4a, not buildozer) via the `pyjnius-deviceinfo`
example in the kivyforge repo, and run on the same real hardware as Step 7
(Pixel 8a, Android 16 / API 36), attached to WSL2 via `usbipd-win`.

**Result — both of kivyforge's own checks pass on-device:**

- `kivyforge run -p android --smoke` (Gradle `connectedDebugAndroidTest` →
  `KivyforgeContractTest`) → **PASS**. The on-device self-test file
  (`kivyforge_selftest.txt`) reads:
  ```
  EXT_OK
  PROXY_OK
  KIVY_CONTRACT_OK
  SELFTEST_ALL_OK
  SELFTEST_DONE
  ```
  `PROXY_OK` is the load-bearing one for this spike: it proves the Java-free
  wheel's `invoke0` native contract round-trips against kivyforge's own
  bootstrap-template copy of `NativeInvocationHandler.java` — the actual
  delivery mechanism this spike settled on, not the ad-hoc harness copy used in
  Step 5.
- The `pyjnius-deviceinfo` example app itself, launched normally (not just the
  contract test), printed:
  ```
  DEVICEINFO_OK Manufacturer: Google | Model: Pixel 8a | Device: akita |
  Android: 16 (API 36) | ABIs: arm64-v8a | Battery: 79% | Screen: 1080x2400 @ 420 dpi
  ```
  confirming `autoclass` reads of `android.os.Build`, `BatteryManager`, and
  `DisplayMetrics` all work through the wheel in a real Kivy app window (SDL2
  window provider, GLES backend up, main loop running).

**Two unrelated bugs surfaced and were fixed to get here (neither is a `pyjnius`
defect — both are pre-existing kivyforge/environment issues this exercise
uncovered):**

1. **Locked device screen.** The app launched behind the keyguard
   (`isKeyguardShowing=true`, `mWakefulness=Dozing`) and never received
   `onWindowFocusChanged`, so `SDLThread` (and therefore Python) never started —
   `onResume()` fired then `onPause()` 7 ms later, indefinitely. This is very
   likely the same failure signature seen throughout the earlier emulator
   debugging (`SDLThread` never created, no window focus) — plausibly the real
   root cause there too, not an emulator/ATD-image defect as originally
   suspected. Fix: wake + `wm dismiss-keyguard` (device has no PIN/pattern, so
   this is sufficient; a secured lock screen would need a manual unlock).
2. **kivyforge's bundled `SDLActivity.java` had a stale SDL version pin.**
   kivyforge's bootstrap vendors a p4a-derived `SDLActivity.java` hardcoding
   `SDL_MAJOR/MINOR/MICRO_VERSION = 2.30.11`, but kivyforge's own
   first-party-built `libSDL2.so` (per `docs/design/dev/
   android-wheel-build-recipe.md`) is actually **2.32.10** — a real version
   skew, caught by `SDLActivity`'s own C/Java version-match guard
   (`"SDL C/Java version mismatch (expected 2.30.11, got 2.32.10)"`). This is a
   pre-existing kivyforge bug, already flagged in kivyforge's own design doc as
   a known gap ("[the official SDL2 tarball's Java glue] should replace the
   p4a-derived glue currently vendored..."). Applied the minimal fix in the
   kivyforge repo (not this one): updated the version constants in
   `kivyforge/platforms/android/bootstrap/templates/sdl2/org/libsdl/app/
   SDLActivity.java` and `SDL_REVISION.txt` to `2.32.10` to match the real
   vendored native library. The fuller fix (swap in the official SDL2 tarball's
   9-file Java glue wholesale) remains open in kivyforge, tracked in its own
   design doc — out of scope for the `pyjnius` spike.

**Also reconfirmed:** kivyforge's Gradle-driven `adb install` for the debug +
androidTest APKs stalls/fails over the `usbipd-win` USB passthrough transport
(`Failed to install-write all apks`), same as the earlier p4a
`adb install` symptom in Step 7. Worked around by installing both APKs manually
with `adb install -r --no-streaming` and driving the instrumentation directly
via `adb shell am instrument -w -r org.kivyforge.deviceinfo.test/
androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner` — a WSL2/usbip transport quirk, not a
kivyforge or `pyjnius` defect.

**Conclusion:** the wheel produced by this spike is now proven not just in an
ad-hoc test harness, but end-to-end inside its actual intended consumer
(kivyforge), through kivyforge's real build pipeline, on real arm64 hardware, at
the newest Android API level tested. This was the last open item before
confidently filing the upstream PR.

## Appendix — draft p4a issue — OBSOLETE (removed 2026-07-20)

The draft `kivy/python-for-android` issue (asking the maintainer to teach the
prebuilt-wheel installer to extract a wheel's `.java/` glue into the bootstrap dex
path) is **obsolete**: p4a consumption is a non-concern under the kivyforge-only,
Java-free-wheel direction, and there is no longer any `.java/` payload to extract.
The full draft text is preserved in git history (pre-2026-07-20) should p4a interop
ever be revisited.
